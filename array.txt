BEan factory and application context :2container
Injection: Constructor and setter
default is singleton other is prototype
Autowire:by name by type none constructor
Anything ending with factory is implementation of beanfactory
If there are multiple beans of the same type,we can use qualifier annotaion on the set method and specify the name of the bean in the qualifier


Lazy Loading lazy-init
default value is false whihc means all beans are instantiated in the container only when the getbean method is called from the main method
lazy-init="true" means the beans are initiated as soon as the ioc container starts up

<context:annotation-config/> is needed to enable annotation in spring
@Autowired is only applicable for stereotype.
@Autowiring is done in the beans.xml file with the autowire attribute of a bean definition.
